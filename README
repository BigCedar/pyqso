PyQSO is a simple Python-based contact logging tool for amateur radio operators.

Assuming that your current working directory is PyQSO's base directory (the directory that the Makefile is in), you can install PyQSO via the terminal with the following command:

   make install

Note: you may need to use sudo for this. Once installed, the following command will run PyQSO:
   
   pyqso

Alternatively, PyQSO can be run with:

   python bin/pyqso

from PyQSO's base directory.

The PyQSO user manual is stored as a LaTeX source file in the doc/ directory. You can compile it with the following command:

   make manual

which will produce the manual.pdf file.

PyQSO depends on:
* gir1.2-gtk-3.0
* python-mpltoolkits.basemap
* python-numpy
* python-matplotlib-1.3.0
